        <h2>Volunteer and Mentor One Summer (VAMOS)</h2>
        <p>
          This is a community organization that aimed to provide free higher
          education to middle-school students from low-income families around
          Chicago. We worked together with mentors from other universities to
          develop a 6-week STEAM curricular for about 30 students each summer,
          and we also instructed them. The program has provided classes on
          programming, mathematics, science, aerospace, etc.

        <h2>MAXIMO NIVEL</h2>
        <p>
          I joined this Study Abroad organization to volunteer for a Construction
          and Renovation project in Peru, Cusco. I collaborated with diverse
          people for two weeks, where we helped to build a dog shelter and a
          children's clinic.
